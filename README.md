# Preface 
- This is a website for a ‘TV-platform’ that provides clients live streaming of Football matches but with
different pricing plans. There in the site, you’ll be able –as a visitor- to check the homepage, pricings, staff,
about, contact, add and view plans in site, and a login-page for the admin/staff members
- As for the login page, its for the admin login where he can edit/add/modify users and other data.
- You can add your order plan to the site by going to the add plan page, there you’ll be able to add your
details and order to register in that plan.
- For demonstrating purposes, we allow anyone to check the Plans table to check who ordered for registration in
the platform. However, you can easily change that from the code and allow only admins and/or specific members to preview the Plans table.
